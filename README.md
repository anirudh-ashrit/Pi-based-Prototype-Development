# LSM Sensor Integration with ADC and Motor Drive Testing on Pie 4
A design to measure the angle of rotation of a Stepper Motor connected to Motor Drive is built. A Potentiometer is connected to change the duty cycle of the PWM which further alters the rotation speed of the motor. An ADC is connected to convert the analog input obtained from the motor to further pass on to the LSM303 sensor, which is a combined functional device of Magnetometer and Accelerometer. The above requirements were implemented on a Pi4 Board.
